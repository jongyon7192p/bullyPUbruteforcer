# Bully PU Bruteforcer, but in Java
As if figuring out how to shoot a rock through space at 0.1 lightspeed wasn't enough, we're going to figure it out 
faster than you could blink an eye.

Based on [this bruteforcer](https://github.com/jongyon7192p/bullyPUbruteforcer) by jongyon7192p and others, just 
ported to Java.
